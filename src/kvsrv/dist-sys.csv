question,answer
What is linearizability?,A consistency model defining correctness for concurrent service requests; operations appear to execute one at a time as they arrive
How is linearizability defined?,On "histories" - traces of client requests and server responses with timestamps; a history is linearizable if linearization points can be assigned within each operation's time frame
What is a key consequence of linearizability?,The service can execute concurrent operations in any order as long as linearization points maintain correct behavior
How do services typically implement linearizability?,By executing client requests one at a time as they arrive; care must be taken to handle retried requests correctly
What are some examples of other consistency models?,"Eventual consistency, causal consistency, fork consistency, serializability, sequential consistency, timeline consistency"
Why is linearizability considered a strong consistency model?,It forbids many situations that might surprise programmers; e.g. reads always see fresh data after a completed write
What are common approaches to ensure correctness in distributed systems?,Thorough testing and use of formal methods for verification
What are some advantages of linearizability for application writers?,"Reads observe fresh data, consistent views among readers, often allows mini-transactions like test-and-set"
What are some drawbacks of weaker consistency models like eventual consistency?,"Reads can see stale data, observe writes out of order, writes may not be immediately visible to subsequent reads"
How do linearizability checkers work?,They try possible operation orders to find valid linearization points; use optimizations to avoid checking impossible orders
What is the relationship between linearizability and transactions?,Transactions (e.g. in serializability) provide stronger guarantees than linearizability by effectively locking accessed data
Why is formal verification of realistic distributed systems challenging?,Proving significant theorems about complex programs requires huge effort beyond ordinary programming
How do teams typically decide when a distributed system is ready to ship?,Balance testing efforts with business constraints; get early customer feedback; ship when functional enough with no known major bugs
Why not use client request send time as the linearization point?,Network delays make it impractical to guarantee execution order matches client send order; would increase latency for all requests
